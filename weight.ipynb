    "#INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Problem Statement\n",
    "Birth weight is a critical indicator of newborn health and future developmental outcomes. Low birth weight (LBW) is linked to increased risks of infant mortality, chronic health conditions, and developmental challenges. Healthcare providers, public health agencies, and policymakers require data-driven insights to identify risk factors and implement effective interventions for improving neonatal health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Goal\n",
    "This project seeks to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze correlations between prenatal care, maternal health, and birth outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide evidence-based recommendations for reducing LBW incidence and enhancing neonatal care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Questions\n",
    "What maternal factors (e.g., age, BMI, health conditions) most strongly correlate with birth weight?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there patterns in birth weight related to prenatal care quality,lifestyle habits(smoking)\n",
    "\n",
    "What interventions (e.g., nutritional programs, healthcare policies) show the greatest potential for improving birth weight?\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Audience\n",
    "Healthcare providers (OB-GYNs, midwives, pediatricians)\n",
    "\n",
    "Public health departments and policymakers\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers in maternal and child health\n",
    "\n",
    "Health insurance providers and community health organizations"
