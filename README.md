# Project Overview
This project analyzes critical factors affecting newborn birth weight, a key indicator of neonatal health. By examining maternal characteristics, prenatal care, and lifestyle habits, we provide data-driven insights to help healthcare providers and policymakers reduce low birth weight (LBW) incidence and improve infant health outcomes.

# Problem Statement
Low birth weight (<2500 grams) is associated with:

- Increased infant mortality risks

- Higher likelihood of chronic health conditions

- Developmental challenges

# Project Goals
- Analyze correlations between prenatal care, maternal health, and birth outcomes

- Identify key modifiable risk factors for low birth weight

- Provide evidence-based recommendations for reducing LBW incidence
